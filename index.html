            <div class="subheading mb-3">ING/iSense Consulting</div>

            <p>
            <h5>Context</h5>
            <p>
              ING is the largest bank in the Netherlands, is has also a massive presence in Belgium, Germany, England
              and many other countries.
              I am a iSense consultant inside ING, however, being a consultant does not means I have less
              responsibilities
              or importance to my team, on the opposite.
            </p>

            <h5>Situation</h5>
            <p>
              I started as a Senior Software Engineer taking care of a legacy monolith java application.
              This application is responsible to handle authorizations for large business accounts.
              When a company, that is ING customers, hires for example an accountant, this new employee can have access
              to the account to handle obligations, such as payments, statements and etc.
              The Mandates API is the backbone of this process, I am responsible for it.
              My main responsibility is to modernize this API.
              The team is also composed of TIBCO developers and is my responsibility to guide them to Java.
              Because we have only one front-end developer, and many front-end applications, sometimes I also help with
              that.
            </p>

            <h5>Tasks</h5>
            <p>
              My main responsibility is to modernize this Mandates API, for this I am refactoring this monolith,
              applying not
              only a modern microservice architecture but also Hexagonal Architecture for every project involved, so we
              have isolated and easily maintainable code.
              Help migrating old Angular 1.7 applications to lit html, when the front end tasks are overwhelming the
              team.
              Make sure our API is available for all environments, because it is heavily consume all over the bank's
              projects.
              Monitore usage and scalability of this API.
            </p>

            <div class="subheading mb-3">QUBY/WAES Consulting</div>

            <p>
            <h5>Context</h5>
            <p>
              Quby is a customer of WAES, the company is part of Eneco Group (one of the biggest energy providers in
              the Netherlands).
              The company is responsible for creating and sell Toon, a smart thermostat that helps the final customer
              to have total control of his gas. energy and water consumption.
            </p>

            <h5>Situation</h5>
            <p>
              I started as a Senior Java developer taking care of a couple of microservices and guiding some embedded
              developers that are migrating from C++ too Java development. One of my main attributions, in the
              beginning, was not only guide those developers but also refactoring the actual codebase using best
              practices, providing logging and a better way to troubleshooting the applications.
              During my last months at Quby, as I fixed and implemented all necessary features and improvements
              regarding Smart Schedule Application, I joined to the Platform Team.
              The Platform Team is responsible for provide all infrastructure services, such as authentication,
              logging, monitoring, metrics, and also some back-office services like orders, customers, location and so
              on.
            </p>

            <h5>Tasks</h5>
            <p>
              I was responsible for getting the things done at the Smart Schedule Application. The Smart Schedule
              Application is a group of microservices that advise the user about the usage of their thermostat, to
              save energy (gas and electricity) and save money. Together with the data science team, we can provide,
              based on a huge amount of data, the best insight about energy and how to save customers’ money.
              In addition to my responsibilities with Smart Schedule Application, I am helping the platform team.
              During this time with the platform team, I fixed some important bugs and helped the team to implement
              contextual logging and metrics to improve our troubleshooting capacity. I also refactored a service
              called Quby Registration, that was using Spring Framework 3 and XML Context, to a modernized situation
              with Spring Boot 2, WebFlux and improving code quality and coverage.

              Sicredi is a customer of CWI Software, it is a digital bank and I’ve been working in the Risk management
              application.
              This app is responsible to control provisions for each money that the bank provides to the customers.
              When a customer uses some bank’s money, for example, a loan, cred card or anything else that costs money
              to the bank,
              the risk management application must save a percentage of this money based on the customer and operation
              rating, this is necessary for the bank to have financial health if customer does not pay back this
              money.
            </p>

            <h5>Situation</h5>

              to
              MongoDB and integrates with other systems to provide insights to the risk users. All microservices and
              front-end run with containers in docker.
              I am responsible, together with the PO, to meet with the business team to decide about new features and
              backlog periodization as well.
              I do lots of scrum ceremonies like planning, review, retrospective, but I propose chapters as well with
              other teams to discuss difficulties and solutions.

              contractor at CWI.
              I’ve worked in the CRM application.
              This application is responsible to manage all bank data about the bank customers and is accessed by more
              than 3000 users inside the Bank, mainly in the agencies or on the streets in outside campaigns.
            </p>

            <h5>Situation</h5>
            <p>
              The CRM application has all information about the customers like, accounts and statements, loans, cred
              cards, insurance, support calls, and messages, etc.
              This application is responsible for leads management as well, the team was responsible for reading
              massive files with customer information, we got messages from Facebook or from the bank website or any
              source, treat and enrich this information and make these customers make available for use for the
              application users.
              Other responsibilities of this application were to make VoIP calls, so we integrated with VoIP solutions
              called Olos, from Brazil, to make and to receive phone calls, and create a solution to do calls for lots
              of leads at the same time and transfer to the user which customer that attempt the call, to the user
              sell some bank products to this customer.
              My team had 8 developers, including me, all developers are full stack and responsible for the entire
              application lifecycle, since the microservice design, including coding, DevOps, CI, front-end
              design and development and so on.
              I started as only a developer, but 4 months later I became the tech lead responsible for lead management
              applications.
              As we worked in a high-pressure environment because it was a regular bank going to the digital
              environment and we needed release features all day, we estimated tasks with hours, not in points, so we
              needed to be accurate about the tasks estimates and meet the deadlines.
              At the beginning of the project, it was composed of 3 .NET Core microservices, but as we were working we
              decided to create more Java microservices because of the way to work with Rabbit and Mongo as faster
              than .NET Core 1.2, and because of custom configurations as well, that I thought it was better to do
              with Qualified Beans.
            </p>

            <h5>Tasks</h5>
            <p>
              I was responsible for Java rest APIS, front-end development.
              My main responsibility was to code very fast rest APIS to integrate with other systems or present data
              from
              SQL Server and MongoDB.
              I was responsible, together with the PO, to meet with the business team to decide about new features and
              backlog periodization as well about the lead management application.
              I did lots of scrum ceremonies like planning, review, retrospective, but I propose chapters as well with
              other teams to discuss difficulties and solutions.

              As I had a lot of experience in the legacy version, I started helping the legacy team to fix application
              bugs and improve queries and procedures' performance.
              Unfortunately, I was looking for something more challenging and innovative, so after 4 months I decided

            <p>
              Sispro is an ERP development company.
              They provide taxes, financial, HR and MRP solutions for Brazilian companies.
              The company is almost 50 years old and a reference in Brazil.
            </p>

            <h5>Situation</h5>
            <p>
              At this stage of my career at Sispro, I was Tech Leader responsible for 2 projects, they were: Material
              requirements planning (MRP) and on promise NF-e.
            <p>Material requirements planning (MRP) is a kind of software used in industries to control
              manufacturing stages and material requirements to produce what they manufacture.</p>
            <p>NF-e is digital taxation for Brazilian companies, the companies must send digital files to the
              government about each sale or purchase they make, for example, this file is an XML file, and a pdf
              with this transaction must be sent to the customers. I called it on-promise because in this version
              the customers pay for the use or some cents for each document they sent to the government.</p>
            Unfortunately, the company decided to freeze the investments in innovation, moreover, I couldn't see any
            career progression for me, so I decided to leave the company, took one month to study and look for a new
            challenge.
            </p>

            <h5>Tasks</h5>
            <p>
              I was responsible for design and implement each application, with my team.
              Sometimes specifics requirements were necessary for some customers, then I was responsible to travel to
              the customers, get these requirements, implement and then, after the development lifecycle, show to the
              customers and ask for their approval.
              I was responsible for choosing a better technical solution for each application, do concept proof and
              implement the solution, always looking for delivery the best solution for the customers and the lowest
              cost

            <h5>Situation</h5>
            <p>
              At this stage of my career at Sispro I started the development of NF-e solution integrated with ERP, not
              on-promise.
            </p>

            <h5>Tasks</h5>
            <p>
              I was responsible for design and NF-e application, integrating with ERP application.
              The application was developed with Outsystems Low Code Solution, but it couldn't communicate with the
              government because of certificate credentials and depending on the state or city there were different
              web services to consume, so almost 60% of the application must be in Java.
              Sometimes specifics requirements were necessary for some customers, then I was responsible to travel to
              the customers, get these requirements, implement and then, after the development lifecycle, show to the
              customers and ask for their approval.
              There was a version of this application to run in desktop for supermarkets, so I wrote this in Java with
              swing, but after done, to improve the performance and deploy, I decided to rewrite it with NodeJs and
              run with Electron.

            <h5>Context</h5>
            <p>
              Sispro is an ERP development company.

            <h5>Situation</h5>
            <p>
              I started my developer career at Sispro in a program that they teach a new developer
              from the basics of how to code in Visual Basic 6. I was selected for this program because I did
              a logic test and I was very good.
            </p>

            <h5>Tasks</h5>
            <p>
              After 2 months of learning how to code with VB6 I started to work in the legacy MRP solution.
              I was responsible to create new features and fix bugs and so on.
              Develop and customize Server Controls Library for use by enterprise developers.
              I supported the architecture in migrating the desktop platform to the cloud environment of the company
              applications.
              After showed that I love to learn and code, they gave me the chance to help in the VB6 to C# migration.
